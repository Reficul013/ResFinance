# ExpoLab Finance Platform Architecture and Delivery Plan

Status: Approved planning baseline for local implementation; cloud deployment is on hold

Last reviewed: 2026-10-15

Implementation status: Milestones 0–9 passed for local development and research. Milestone 9 includes the local lifecycle, explicit workers, operator guide, continuous real-service browser proof, the original provider-data research run, and the predeclared untouched-forward completion protocol. The validation-locked candidate abstained to the naive return forecast, tied its forward MAE, exceeded required interval coverage, passed the unchanged immutable gate, and published a provenance-complete current-cutoff snapshot. Milestone 10 production hardening and deployment remains on hold.

Deployment status: On hold pending a separate, evidence-backed ResilientDB cloud feasibility review. Current work is limited to local development, integration, research, and end-to-end validation.

## 1. Summary and Product Boundaries

ExpoLab will be a wallet-authenticated finance platform with three interconnected product dashboards and embedded read-only insights:

1. **Personal Finance** — income, expenses, budgets, savings, receivables, payables, and financial insights.
2. **Friends & Groups** — shared expenses, participant approval, obligations, internal-credit settlements, and immutable receipts.
3. **Crypto Investments** — BTC, ETH, and SOL market analysis, forecasts, risk profiling, portfolio allocation, scenarios, and AI explanations.
4. **Smart Insights** — wallet-authorized, evidence-linked explanations and cross-dashboard notifications without write or wallet authority, embedded beneath Personal Finance rather than exposed as a fourth dashboard tab.

Non-negotiable boundaries:

- Apache ResilientDB is the only persistent application and research database.
- No PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, DuckDB, Redis, Parquet-based persistence, or external object store.
- Crypto support is hard-limited to `BTC | ETH | SOL` at API, ingestion, model, UI, and test boundaries.
- Frontend-to-backend communication is REST under `/api/v1`.
- ResWallet performs authentication and signs contract-affecting actions.
- ResContract executes meaningful obligation and settlement-credit state transitions.
- V1 does not transfer fiat or native cryptocurrency, execute trades, provide exchange custody, or claim that internal credits have monetary value.
- The AI agent is read-only and cannot alter records, sign actions, settle obligations, or trade.
- Cloud and production deployment work is out of scope until explicitly resumed after ResilientDB cloud compatibility, operations, and failure behavior are validated.

### Dashboard dependencies

| Producer | Consumer | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| ResWallet | All dashboards | Login challenge signing; explicit signatures for split approval, credit funding, and settlement |
| Groups | Finance | Accepted obligations become receivables/payables; confirmed contract settlements update finance balances and savings |
| Finance | Crypto | Versioned available-savings calculation provides the default investment amount |
| Market/ML pipeline | Crypto | Immutable feature snapshots, forecasts, confidence intervals, and model provenance |
| Risk profile | Portfolio optimizer | Converts the user score into a versioned risk-aversion and allocation policy |
| All three domains | AI agent | Read-only fact bundle with record IDs, timestamps, and provenance |
| Crypto scenario | Finance | No mutation; an alternate amount only changes the scenario response |

### Frontend

- Shared authenticated shell with `/finance`, `/groups`, and `/crypto`; settings are shared UI, not a fourth dashboard.
- React Router, TanStack Query, generated OpenAPI TypeScript types, React Hook Form, and Zod.
- Shadcn/UI and Tailwind for accessible, responsive components.
- Recharts for budgets, cash flow, allocations, risk, and forecast evaluation.
- TradingView Lightweight Charts for BTC/ETH/SOL price and forecast overlays.
- Access tokens held in memory; no application records in browser local storage or IndexedDB.
- Every screen displays data freshness and provenance. Forecasts and allocations carry a non-advice disclaimer.

### Backend and workers

Use one FastAPI codebase with clear module boundaries rather than premature microservices:

- **API process:** REST, validation, authentication, orchestration, OpenAPI.
- **Ingestion worker:** market, on-chain, and sentiment collection.
- **ML worker:** datasets, training, evaluation, forecasts, and artifact persistence.
- **Reconciliation worker:** repairs event indexes and contract-to-finance saga interruptions.
- **AI worker:** grounded, read-only explanations with deterministic fallback.

Workers are singleton deployments in V1. Jobs, leases, status, failures, and retry records are stored in ResilientDB; process memory and temporary computation files may be ephemeral.

### ResilientDB data architecture

Use append-only events, deterministic keys, and prefix/range queries. Do not depend on a “list everything” endpoint or treat the current Python ORM as a production repository layer.

Core envelope:

```text
DomainEvent {
  schema_version,
  event_id,
  event_type,
  occurred_at_utc,
  tenant_id,
  actor_id,
  aggregate_type,
  aggregate_id,
  aggregate_version,
  idempotency_key,
  encrypted_payload,
  payload_hash,
  source_references[],
  contract_receipt?
}
```

Key families:

- `evt:{tenant}:{type}:{aggregate}:{timestamp}:{event_id}`
- `idx:{tenant}:{subject}:{stream}:{timestamp}:{event_id}`
- `cmd:{tenant}:{idempotency_key}`
- `mkt:{asset}:{interval}:{timestamp}:{provider}:{revision}`
- `chain:{asset}:{metric}:{timestamp}:{provider}:{revision}`
- `sent:{asset}:{timestamp}:{model_hash}:{revision}`
- `feat:{dataset_hash}:{asset}:{timestamp}`
- `forecast:{model_hash}:{asset}:{as_of}:{horizon}`
- `run:{run_id}:manifest`
- `blob:{sha256}:{chunk_number}`
- `snapshot:{projection}:{subject}:{as_of}:{hash}`

Rules:

- Events are immutable; corrections append compensating events.
- Secondary indexes and projections are rebuildable.
- Generated model artifacts are compressed, split into 256 KiB content-addressed chunks, stored in ResilientDB, and verified against a manifest hash.
- Temporary training files are deleted after successful verified persistence.
- Sensitive payloads use AES-256-GCM envelope encryption. Local development uses non-production key handling that never commits secrets. A production KMS design remains deferred with the deployment plan; when resumed, KMS may wrap per-user and per-group data keys but must never store application records.
- Cleartext indexes contain only pseudonymous identifiers, record type, schema version, and timestamps.
- Erasure uses a tombstone plus destruction of the applicable data-encryption key; immutable ciphertext may remain replicated.
- Money uses integer USD cents. Crypto quantities and prices use validated decimal strings, never binary floating point.

### REST and shared types

Principal endpoints:

- Authentication: `POST /auth/challenges`, `POST /auth/sessions`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `DELETE /auth/sessions/current`.
- Finance: transactions, budgets, recurring items, summaries, savings, obligations, and insights.
- Groups: groups, members, expenses, splits, approvals, obligations, settlements, balances, and receipts.
- Crypto: asset catalog, prices, signals, forecasts, risk profile, recommendations, saved analyses, and non-mutating scenarios.
- AI: `POST /assistant/explain`.
- Research administration: run submission, status, manifest, metrics, and approved model promotion.

All write endpoints require an `Idempotency-Key`. Errors use RFC 9457 Problem Details. Responses expose `event_id`, `projection_version`, and relevant source or contract receipt IDs.

Shared public types:

```text
CryptoAsset = BTC | ETH | SOL
Money = { currency: "USD", minor_units: int64 }
SignedIntent = {
  version, intent_id, action, actor_public_key, actor_address,
  resource_id, parameters_hash, nonce, issued_at, expires_at,
  origin, audience, network_id, signature
}
Forecast = {
  asset, as_of, horizon_days, expected_return,
  probability_up, p10, p50, p90, model_hash, dataset_hash
}
PortfolioRecommendation = {
  source_savings_event, capital, risk_score, horizon_days,
  weights, dollar_allocations, forecast_ids, policy_version, warnings
}
```

Signed intents use RFC 8785 canonical JSON and Ed25519. The backend verifies signature, origin/audience, network, expiry, nonce, payload hash, and expected resource state before invoking ResContract.

### Wallet and smart-contract behavior

Milestone 0 will audit the pinned official ResVault implementation before choosing a maintenance strategy. The audit must trace seed and private-key handling across extension storage, background code, content scripts, page messaging, network requests, and logs. It will produce one of three evidence-backed outcomes:

1. Use the pinned upstream implementation unchanged if it satisfies every key-isolation and signed-intent requirement.
2. Maintain a minimal fork, documented by an architecture decision record, if narrowly scoped compatibility or security patches are required.
3. Build a documented custom ResWallet implementation if the upstream implementation cannot be made safe with a minimal patch. The larger effort must preserve the required wallet role and explicit approval behavior and pass the same security contract; complexity alone does not remove wallet-dependent functionality from scope.

Whichever implementation is approved will:

- Remain pinned to a reviewed upstream Apache commit.
- Keep signing inside the extension background context.
- Return only the public key, address, and signature to the page.
- Store only an Argon2id-derived, AES-GCM-encrypted seed; the password and decrypted seed remain memory-only while unlocked.
- Enforce an application-origin allowlist and explicit user approval for contract-affecting signatures.
- Support challenge signing, split approval, settlement authorization, and receipt verification.

The current planning review identified potential exposure in the page-messaging and key-storage paths, but this is a hypothesis to validate against the pinned source rather than a pre-authorized large fork. The audit will record concrete source references, executable key-leak tests, and the minimum required remediation before Milestone 2 begins. Relevant upstream surfaces include ResVault’s [`content.js`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/blob/master/ecosystem/tools/resvault/public/content.js) and [`background.js`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/blob/master/ecosystem/tools/resvault/public/background.js).

`ResFinanceSettlement.sol` will implement:

- Wallet registration by derived address and public-key hash.
- Controlled issuance of explicitly non-redeemable settlement credits.
- Split creation with payer, participants, exact USD-cent obligations, and immutable expense reference.
- Per-participant signed approval or rejection.
- Partial or full settlement from debtor credits to creditor credits.
- Replay, duplicate, insufficient-balance, overpayment, and post-settlement mutation prevention.
- `PENDING`, `OPEN`, `PARTIALLY_SETTLED`, `SETTLED`, `REJECTED`, and `CANCELLED` states.
- Queryable balances, obligations, intent hashes, nonces, and settlement receipts.

ResContract does not currently establish wallet signature authorization by itself. Therefore:

- Its GraphQL/CLI service remains private and firewall-restricted.
- Only the FastAPI contract gateway may reach it.
- The gateway verifies the Ed25519 signed intent before supplying the compatible caller address.
- The contract records the actor address, signed-intent hash, and nonce.
- This is a permissioned gateway design, not a claim of fully trustless end-to-end wallet execution.

The contract is authoritative for obligation and settlement state. Finance is updated only after confirmed contract state. A saga and reconciler repair crashes between the contract operation and its corresponding finance event.

### Crypto data, ML, portfolio, and AI

Data adapters:

- Coin Metrics Community for daily BTC/ETH/SOL price, volume, capitalization, and available BTC/ETH on-chain metrics.
- CoinGecko for current quotes and UI fallback.
- DefiLlama for SOL TVL and stablecoin-supply proxies because the audited Coin Metrics Community catalog does not expose comparable native SOL on-chain series.
- GDELT GKG historical tone/coverage and DOC API live news metadata; do not persist full copyrighted articles.
- `facebook/bart-large-mnli`, pinned by model revision and hash, for supplemental bullish/bearish/neutral headline classification.

The adapters retain source URL/query, retrieval time, provider revision, license metadata, row counts, checksums, availability time, and missingness. Official references: [Coin Metrics API v4](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4/), [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), [DefiLlama API](https://api-docs.defillama.com/), and [GDELT DOC 2.0](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-doc-2-0-api-debuts/). The current coverage and permission disposition is maintained in [`provider-terms-review.md`](provider-terms-review.md); conditional or blocked sources are not production-approved merely because a probe succeeds.

Research dataset V1:

- Daily UTC observations from 2020-04-10 through 2025-01-01.
- Exactly BTC, ETH, and SOL.
- Market, sentiment, and asset-specific on-chain/proxy channels.
- Point-in-time joins using source availability timestamps.
- Missing-source masks are model inputs; unavailable metrics are not silently imputed as zero.

Model:

- Separate market, sentiment, and on-chain encoders.
- Masked softmax Adaptive Multi-Source Gating per asset and time step.
- Multi-scale patching, channel-independent Transformer blocks, and learnable aggregation following the MSPCIFormer design.
- Horizons: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 15 days.
- Heads for expected return, direction probability, and p10/p50/p90 quantiles.
- Split-conformal calibration on validation windows.
- Required ablations: market-only, fixed equal fusion, adaptive gating, and one-source-removed variants.
- Baselines: naive last value/zero return, linear model, and an LSTM or equivalent sequence baseline.

The published MSPCIFormer experiment used eight input assets and only ADA/BTC/ETH targets; this project is therefore a documented three-asset adaptation, not an exact reproduction. The paper and author repository remain provenance inputs, but source code must not be copied until its absent license is resolved: [MSPCIFormer paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exsy.70343), [author repository](https://github.com/cmajorsolo/MSPCIFormer). The Gurgul baseline is similarly adapted to the permitted data and assets: [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14759), [journal DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2025.02.007).

Every research run persists:

- Git commit, configuration, code and dependency hashes.
- Docker image digest, Python/PyTorch versions, hardware, deterministic seed, and determinism flags.
- Input record IDs, dataset manifest/hash, split boundaries, preprocessing parameters, and feature schema.
- Checkpoint, predictions, metrics, plots, gate weights, warnings, and parent-run relationship.
- Five expanding walk-forward folds with embargo and no random shuffling.
- MAE, RMSE, directional accuracy, Brier score, interval coverage/width, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and transaction-cost sensitivity.

Portfolio optimization:

- Long-only BTC/ETH/SOL weights summing to one.
- Ledoit-Wolf covariance from trailing daily returns.
- Fifteen-day forecast as the default expected-return horizon.
- Objective: maximize uncertainty-adjusted expected return minus risk-score-dependent variance.
- Default caps: BTC 80%, ETH 60%, and SOL from 10% at risk score 0 to 35% at risk score 100.
- CLARABEL solver with SCS fallback; nearest positive-semidefinite covariance repair and minimum-variance fallback.
- Default capital comes from the versioned finance savings calculation.
- “Analyze Another Amount” changes dollar allocations in an isolated scenario and never changes finance records or the default savings source.

AI agent:

- Receives only a structured, authorized fact bundle assembled by domain services.
- Uses a pinned Hugging Face instruction model selected during the feasibility milestone from permissively licensed models small enough for the target VM.
- May explain budgets, obligations, forecasts, gating, uncertainty, and portfolio allocations.
- Returns structured `summary`, `evidence`, `caveats`, and `follow_up_questions`.
- Cannot call mutation tools or access ResilientDB, ResContract, ResWallet, or external trading systems directly.
- Falls back to deterministic templates if evidence coverage or model confidence is insufficient.

## 3. ResilientDB Feasibility Conclusions

The integration is **conditionally feasible**, with mandatory validation before feature development.

- ResilientDB currently exposes KV, versioned history/range concepts, REST/GraphQL components, Python tooling, ResContract, and ResVault in the official Apache repository. However, the SDK/ORM surface is not mature enough to adopt directly as the domain persistence layer. ExpoLab needs a narrow, tested repository adapter. [Apache ResilientDB repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/blob/master/README.md)
- Some advertised or older “read all” behavior is not reliable in the current KV HTTP implementation. Queries must use known deterministic keys and prefix ranges. [Current KV service implementation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/blob/master/service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools.cpp)
- ResContract can create, compile, deploy, and execute Solidity contracts, but its service boundary does not provide the required wallet-signature verification. Self-hosting, network isolation, and the signed-intent gateway are therefore mandatory. [ResContract source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/tree/master/ecosystem/smart-contract/rescontract)
- The upstream ResVault source must pass the pinned-source key-isolation audit before any code reuse is accepted. Because it failed, the project implements the evidence-backed custom ResWallet architecture. Wallet-dependent functionality remains in scope. [ResVault source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/tree/master/ecosystem/tools/resvault)
- ResSQL is excluded because its implementation is DuckDB-based and conflicts with the sole-database constraint.
- A four-replica local Docker setup is suitable for development but does not provide independent Byzantine fault domains. No cloud or production resilience claim will be made while deployment is on hold.
- Large model artifacts remain feasible only if the chunked round-trip spike succeeds. No fallback database or object store is permitted.

Cloud deployment is not part of the current feasibility gate. If deployment work is resumed, it requires a new decision record and a separate spike proving that the pinned ResilientDB stack can be operated safely in the selected cloud environment before any infrastructure is provisioned.

Go/no-go validation must prove:

1. Commit, get, prefix range, history/version, restart durability, and one-replica failure behavior.
2. A 100 MB checkpoint can be persisted as 256 KiB logical chunks and reconstructed with identical SHA-256. A CLI-based spike may segment each logical chunk into transport-safe records (64 KiB was required by the local process argument limit); the production adapter must preserve the logical manifest and prove its selected binary or segmented transport.
3. A Solidity contract can be compiled, deployed, executed, queried, and restarted on the pinned stack.
4. A signed ResWallet settlement travels through REST, passes backend verification, changes contract state, and produces a ResilientDB finance event.
5. The browser page, network traffic, server, and logs never receive a private key or seed.
6. BTC/ETH/SOL provider samples and the fixed research-period data can be acquired with recorded license/provenance.
7. If any test fails, work stops at the adapter or upstream integration layer; another persistent database is not introduced.

## 4. Dependency-Ordered Roadmap

### Milestone 0 — Architecture and feasibility gate

Milestone 0 implementations are narrow, disposable feasibility spikes unless a later milestone explicitly adopts them. They must exercise the real pinned boundaries and preserve every security and storage invariant, but they do not need the complete product UI, domain breadth, or operational hardening assigned to later milestones. Passing a spike proves that the dependency can support the planned design; it does not replace the maintainable implementation or tests required by Milestones 1–9.

- Populate the root `AGENTS.md` and add reviewed architecture, feasibility, REST-contract, security, and research-protocol documents.
- Pin the ResilientDB, ResContract, upstream ResVault reference, ResWallet dependencies, compiler, Python, Node, and model revisions.
- Audit the pinned official ResVault implementation and record whether unchanged upstream use, a minimal fork, or a custom ResWallet implementation is warranted.
- Build a reproducible local ResilientDB artifact from the pinned source and use it for the real-stack gates; an unattested public image is insufficient.
- Implement only the minimum secure signing and REST-to-contract-to-event vertical slice needed to prove the signed-settlement boundary. No spike may expose a private key, bypass intent verification, or introduce substitute persistence.
- Run all seven go/no-go tests above.
- Produce a signed decision record for any local fork or compatibility patch.

**Acceptance:** every feasibility test passes in CI or the project remains blocked with reproducible failure evidence.

### Milestone 1 — Platform foundation

**Status:** complete for local development; evidence is recorded in [`milestone1-platform-foundation.md`](milestone1-platform-foundation.md).

- Establish React/Vite and FastAPI modular boundaries, OpenAPI generation, error format, validation, linting, and CI.
- Implement the ResilientDB event/blob repository, encryption envelope, deterministic keys, idempotency, projection rebuild, and provider interfaces.
- Provide four-node development Compose topology and private service networking.

**Acceptance:** contract tests write, restart, read, rebuild, and deduplicate encrypted sample events without another database.

### Milestone 2 — Hardened wallet and authentication

**Status:** complete for local development; evidence is recorded in [`milestone2-wallet-authentication.md`](milestone2-wallet-authentication.md).

- Implement the Milestone 0 ResVault audit decision by completing the documented custom ResWallet extension required by the failed audit.
- Implement challenge login, in-memory access tokens, refresh-session hashes in ResilientDB, logout/revocation, address derivation, and signed-intent verification.
- Add replay, tamper, expiry, wrong-origin, wrong-network, and locked-wallet defenses.

**Acceptance:** approved challenges authenticate; all altered or replayed intents fail; automated inspection finds no key leakage.

### Milestone 3 — Personal Finance dashboard

**Status:** complete for local development; evidence is recorded in [`milestone3-personal-finance.md`](milestone3-personal-finance.md).

- Implement income/expense events, the fixed direction-aware category catalog, budgets, recurring entries, summaries, savings calculation, and receivable/payable projections.
- Build accessible charts, validation, empty/loading/error states, provenance views, and confirmed per-record correction actions that append void or deactivation events without deleting history.
- Version the savings formula used by Crypto.

**Acceptance:** unit and Playwright tests reproduce balances from events, budget alerts, monthly savings, and projection rebuilds exactly.

### Milestone 4 — Groups and contractual settlement

**Status:** complete for local development; evidence is recorded in [`milestone4-groups-settlement.md`](milestone4-groups-settlement.md).

- Implement groups, membership, expenses, split validation, participant approval, obligation projections, and notifications.
- Deploy `ResFinanceSettlement.sol`.
- Implement non-redeemable credit issuance, partial/full settlements, receipts, finance propagation, and saga reconciliation.

**Acceptance:** multi-user E2E test creates a split, obtains approvals, rejects unsigned/tampered actions, settles partially and fully, prevents overpayment/replay, and shows matching Group and Finance balances after an injected crash.

### Milestone 5 — Crypto ingestion and feature store

**Status:** complete for local, non-commercial research; evidence is recorded in [`milestone5-crypto-ingestion-feature-store.md`](milestone5-crypto-ingestion-feature-store.md).

- Add Coin Metrics, CoinGecko, DefiLlama, and GDELT adapters.
- Persist immutable raw observations, derived features, availability masks, licenses, and checksums.
- Enforce the three-asset enum at every boundary.

**Acceptance:** a repeat ingestion is idempotent, provider failure does not corrupt existing data, point-in-time joins pass leakage tests, and any fourth asset is rejected.

### Milestone 6 — Reproducible ML research

**Status:** complete for local research mechanics; evidence is recorded in [`milestone6-reproducible-ml-research.md`](milestone6-reproducible-ml-research.md). No smoke model was promoted, and no statistical or investment-performance claim is made.

- Implement baselines, the three-asset MSPCIFormer adaptation, Adaptive Multi-Source Gating, walk-forward evaluation, conformal intervals, ablations, and artifact persistence.
- Add deterministic smoke datasets generated in test code and a full research-run manifest.
- Promote models only through explicit evaluation criteria and an immutable promotion event.

**Acceptance:** repeated CPU smoke runs have identical dataset/prediction hashes; full runs retain complete provenance; adaptive gating is reported against every required baseline without overstating statistical significance.

### Milestone 7 — Risk, portfolio, and Crypto dashboard

**Status:** complete for local development and synthetic acceptance; evidence is recorded in [`milestone7-risk-portfolio-crypto-dashboard.md`](milestone7-risk-portfolio-crypto-dashboard.md). No forecast is available to the normal runtime until a Milestone 6 model passes promotion.

- Implement questionnaire scoring, policy versioning, CVXPY optimization, fallback behavior, forecasts, chart overlays, allocations, and non-mutating scenarios.
- Connect the default amount to Finance savings through an immutable source event ID.

**Acceptance:** weights satisfy every constraint, dollar allocations reconcile to the input amount, stale forecasts are rejected, and scenarios leave Finance unchanged.

### Milestone 8 — Read-only AI and cross-dashboard integration

**Status:** complete for local development; evidence is recorded in [`milestone8-read-only-ai-integration.md`](milestone8-read-only-ai-integration.md). The local model selects authorized facts only; validated server templates render final claims.

- Benchmark and pin the local Hugging Face instruction model.
- Implement authorized fact bundles, evidence-linked generation, refusal rules, template fallback, and prompt-injection defenses.
- Complete cross-dashboard navigation and in-app notifications.

**Acceptance:** responses cite only supplied facts, unsupported questions trigger a caveat/fallback, and no AI path can invoke a write or wallet operation.

### Milestone 9 — Local Handoff

**Status:** complete for local development and research. The first provider-data candidate remains rejected; the later predeclared untouched-forward candidate passed the unchanged gate and its live recommendation passed the real-stack browser journey. Evidence is recorded in [`milestone9-local-handoff.md`](milestone9-local-handoff.md), with operating instructions in [`milestone9-local-operator-guide.md`](milestone9-local-operator-guide.md).

- Package a one-command local startup with preflight checks, bounded health waits, status, clean shutdown, and an explicitly confirmed reset path.
- Prove one continuous, non-mocked browser journey through the real ResWallet extension, React client, FastAPI API, four-replica ResilientDB stack, ResContract, local workers, and read-only AI path.
- Provide isolated multi-wallet browser profiles and deterministic non-secret fixtures for Finance, Groups, settlement, Crypto, notifications, and Smart Insights.
- Run approved full-scale BTC/ETH/SOL research and promote a forecast only if it passes the existing immutable evaluation criteria. Never weaken the gate merely to complete the milestone.
- Produce an operator handoff covering prerequisites, resource requirements, model/data provisioning, troubleshooting, restart recovery, cleanup, known limitations, and acceptance evidence.

The approved completion iteration adds these five required work packages:

1. Develop a predeclared adaptive-gating candidate on a revised protocol with an untouched forward holdout. Its adaptive MAE must be no worse than naive and its interval coverage must be at least 70 percent. The already-observed five-fold test results may not be used for model or calibration selection.
2. Write the immutable `research.model-promoted` event only after that candidate passes the unchanged promotion gate. A rejected or incomplete run cannot be promoted.
3. Ingest current BTC/ETH/SOL provider observations under `available_at` point-in-time rules, freeze the promoted final model, generate current 15-day returns, upside probabilities, and uncertainty intervals, and persist a forecast snapshot linked to the exact dataset, model artifact, research run, and promotion event.
4. Prove the normal Crypto dashboard recommendation path, exact-cent allocation reconciliation, Finance-derived default savings, non-mutating `Analyze Another Amount`, and fail-closed behavior for stale, corrupted, or unpromoted forecasts.
5. Repeat the complete Python, client, ResWallet, build, lint, type-check, and real two-wallet/restart acceptance suites. Mark Milestone 9 complete only after the live recommendation succeeds through the real local stack.

**Acceptance:** after documented prerequisites, one command starts the complete local stack and reaches healthy state; the predeclared untouched-forward evaluation passes the unchanged promotion criteria; an immutable promotion and provenance-complete current-cutoff snapshot exist; and a real-browser test without API interception completes the wallet-authenticated Finance → Groups → settlement → Finance → Crypto recommendation → non-mutating scenario → Insights journey, including exact-cent allocation and controlled restart. Stale, corrupted, and unpromoted forecast inputs must fail closed. If any condition fails, the safe gated state remains correct but Milestone 9 remains incomplete.

### Milestone 10 — Production hardening and deployment — ON HOLD

- Do not provision cloud infrastructure or implement a production deployment pipeline until this milestone is explicitly resumed.
- Before resumption, validate the pinned ResilientDB stack in the proposed cloud environment, including networking, persistent storage, restart recovery, replica failure, operational support, and independent failure domains.
- If that validation passes, define the deployment architecture in an ADR before implementing TLS/reverse proxy, static frontend hosting, API/workers, private ResContract, KMS integration, backups, observability, or deployment automation.
- Local load, accessibility, browser, chaos, and security testing may continue because it also supports implementation quality.

**Acceptance:** deferred. When resumed, acceptance criteria must be re-approved using evidence from the selected cloud environment. Until then, completion of Milestones 0–9 does not imply production readiness or cloud support.

## 5. Test Strategy and Risk Gates

Required suites:

- **Frontend:** Vitest component/state tests, generated-client compatibility, accessibility, and Playwright journeys across the three authenticated dashboards and embedded Smart Insights.
- **Backend:** Pytest unit, REST contract, authorization, encryption, idempotency, reducer, and provider-adapter tests.
- **ResilientDB:** real four-node integration, restart durability, range/history behavior, blob reconstruction, projection repair, and replica-loss tests.
- **Wallet/security:** origin isolation, private-key non-disclosure, locked-state behavior, replay/tamper/expiry rejection, and session revocation.
- **Contracts:** state transitions, authorization boundary, arithmetic, partial settlement, overpayment, duplicate nonce, cancellation, and receipt lookup.
- **ML:** no-lookahead joins, deterministic hashes, chronological folds, missing-source masks, baseline/ablation comparison, interval coverage, and artifact restoration.
- **Portfolio:** weight/cap invariants, solver failure, PSD repair, stale forecast, zero savings, and scenario non-mutation.
- **AI:** evidence coverage, hallucination, prompt injection, cross-user isolation, prohibited action requests, and deterministic fallback.

Principal risks and enforced responses:

- **SDK/API maturity:** isolate all upstream behavior behind adapters and pin commits.
- **Wallet key exposure:** choose unchanged upstream use, a minimal patch, or substantial hardening from audit evidence. Do not remove wallet-dependent functionality from scope because the required work is large, and do not accept the selected implementation until it passes key-leak tests.
- **Caller spoofing in ResContract:** private network plus mandatory signed gateway; never expose the contract service publicly.
- **Non-atomic contract/KV writes:** authoritative contract state, idempotent saga, and reconciliation worker.
- **Large artifact limits:** validate chunking before ML work; improve ResilientDB/configuration rather than add object storage.
- **Immutable sensitive data:** encrypt before persistence, minimize indexes, and use cryptographic erasure.
- **Provider gaps and drift:** availability masks, source revisions, fallback adapters, and no assumption of uniform SOL metrics.
- **Paper/code licensing:** reimplement from the published method unless explicit reuse permission or a license is obtained.
- **Research divergence:** label the work a three-asset adaptation and report dataset/provider differences.
- **Unvalidated cloud operation:** keep deployment on hold and do not claim production or BFT resilience. Any future deployment must prove that replicas span independent failure domains.
- **Internal-credit interpretation:** label credits non-redeemable and non-monetary throughout UI, API, and documentation.
- **LLM factuality:** evidence-bound read-only responses and deterministic fallback.
- **Financial harm:** no trade execution, no guaranteed-return language, and visible uncertainty/non-advice notices.

## 6. Root `AGENTS.md` Contract

The existing empty root `AGENTS.md` will be the first repository file populated after plan approval. It will stay concise and point to detailed architecture and research documents, following Codex’s hierarchical instruction behavior described in the [OpenAI Codex Prompting Guide](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/gpt-5/codex_prompting_guide).

It will establish these development conventions and non-negotiable rules:

- ResilientDB is the sole persistent application/research database; ResSQL, DuckDB, local artifact persistence, and hidden test databases are prohibited.
- Only BTC, ETH, and SOL may appear in crypto domain types, providers, models, UI, or fixtures.
- Browser code communicates with application services only through generated REST clients.
- No browser code may contact ResilientDB, ResContract GraphQL, or contract CLI endpoints.
- ResWallet seeds/private keys never leave the extension; contract-affecting commands require a verified signed intent.
- Contract state is authoritative for obligations and settlements; Finance changes only from confirmed receipts.
- Sensitive values are encrypted before ResilientDB; secrets, private keys, raw passwords, and PII never enter logs.
- Domain records are append-only, schema-versioned, idempotent, UTC-based, and reducer-rebuildable.
- Money uses integer minor units or validated decimals; binary floats are forbidden for monetary calculations.
- Scenario analysis cannot alter Finance or the default savings source.
- AI is read-only and evidence-bound.
- Every ML run requires data/code/config/environment/model hashes, chronological splits, fixed seeds, and complete manifests.
- No MSPCIFormer source is copied until licensing is resolved.
- Python uses type-checked domain boundaries, Ruff, mypy, and Pytest; TypeScript uses strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and generated API types.
- FastAPI/Pydantic transport types do not replace domain models; infrastructure imports must not leak into domain modules.
- Every behavioral change includes tests at the lowest appropriate layer plus an integration test for cross-module behavior.
- Architecture exceptions require an ADR and explicit review; failures never justify silently introducing another database.
- Directory boundaries are:
  - `client/src/{app,features,components,lib}`
  - `server/app/{api,domain,application,infrastructure,workers}`
  - `blockchain/{contracts,adapter,tests}`
  - `ml/{data,features,models,evaluation,portfolio}`
  - `tests/{contract,integration,e2e}`

## 7. Locked Assumptions

- USD is the only fiat denomination in V1.
- Group settlement uses internal, non-redeemable ledger credits; no fiat, native BTC/ETH/SOL, or token transfer occurs.
- Free-first data adapters are the default, with provider variability accepted and recorded.
- Research baseline dates are fixed; live inference uses the latest completed UTC day.
- ResWallet dependencies and ResContract are pinned and self-hosted. The upstream ResVault reference remains pinned for audit provenance; ResWallet is maintained as the custom ResFinance implementation selected by ADR 0001.
- Cloud and production deployment are on hold. No cloud topology, provider, or operational service is currently approved.
- If deployment is resumed, four ResilientDB replicas across independent failure domains remain a prerequisite, not a current implementation claim.
- Any future operational logging service may contain operational logs only; all application audit records must remain in ResilientDB.
- Source code and deterministic synthetic test generators live in Git; generated research data and artifacts live only in ResilientDB.
- Failure of a mandatory feasibility gate blocks the affected feature rather than relaxing the sole-database, key-isolation, or signed-settlement constraints.
